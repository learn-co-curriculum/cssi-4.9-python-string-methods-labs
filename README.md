# Now it's your turn to use string methods.

?: Get enthusiastic about Python! How do I print out "I love Python" in all caps?

[ ] "I love Python".swapcase()
[ ] "I love Python".upper()
[ ] "I love Python".uppercase()

?: Use a method to print out how long this sentence is: "This is a pretty long string. I wonder how long it is?"

[ ] len("This is a pretty long string. I wonder how long it is?")
[ ] "This is a pretty long string. I wonder how long it is?".swapcase()
[ ] printlength("This is a pretty long string. I wonder how long it is?")

?: Wouldn't it be great if there was a string method that always capitalized the first letter of a string? There is! "make it capitalize the first letter in this string!"

[ ] "make it capitalize the first letter in this string!".upper()
[ ] "make it capitalize the first letter in this string!".swapcase()
[ ] "make it capitalize the first letter in this string!".capitalize()
